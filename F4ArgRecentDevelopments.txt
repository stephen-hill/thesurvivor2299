Chronology:
* All times are in UTC/GMT (PST is -8, EST is -5).
* Bolded times are “as near as facts as we can get.”
* Italic times are speculation.


Dec 2nd
03:28 - New Morse code (Unknown-3-7667)
CQ CQ CQ DE VT 119 SOS LVL4 UND ATTK OS IS DEAD II SOS LVL4 UND ATTK OS IS DEAD WE WNT MK I
* Attempted translation:
Calling all stations, this is Vault 119, SOS, Level 4 is under attack, Overseer is dead, repeat, SOS, Level 4 is under attack, Overseer is dead. (We want Mark I? We won’t make it?)


Dec 1st
21:30-03:20 - The website is non responsive for most people.


22:03 - New Morse code (Unknown-2-7667)
CQ CQ CQ DE VT OS 119 ANB NR QBN SOS V DR BRE II SOS V DR BRE EN UNKN LVL 1 2 3 GONE SRV ON SL LVL 4
* Attempted translation:
Calling all stations, this is Vault Overseer 119, anybody near Quabbin? SOS Vault door breach, repeat, SOS Vault door breach, enemy unknown, level 1, 2, and 3 gone, survivors on (service lift? sealed? secure location?) level 4




21:10 - New Morse code (Unknown-7667)
cq cq cq de ovs 119 emrg en unkn sos sos sos vt 119 qbn 7667 ii sos sos sos vt 119 qbn 7667 en unkn
* qc: Calling all stations
* sos: General distress call. It does NOT stand for anything specific.
* Translation attempted:
Calling all stations, this is overseer 119 emergency enemy unknown, SOS. Vault 119 Quabbin 7667, repeat, SOS, Vault 119 Quabbin 7667 enemy unknown.
* Unusually, this MP3 breaks the file naming convention. It is named Unknown-7667.mp3, breaking the Location-timestamp.mp3 naming convention.


20:35 - The timer expires, site struggles under heavy load, New message:
KVNGR REV ALPHA PPS VT    PIZ UHMYLPVOQ CM XHWMZP. NBJB SPI'F BYQS QT D'Y BYFGEOB FI VQDYL MAQ. -NGQHT 5120- 
* Translation attempted:
THE INSTITUTE IS SEALED. THEY WON'T HELP US.    I'M HEADING TO BLACK ROW. -NGQHT 5120-
* It’s a reversed (REV ALPHA) keyed Vigénere cipher (KVNGR), using passphrase “VAULT TEC” (PPS VT)
* It is still unclear what -TBNLS 5120-  is-possibly a sign off.
* This is the first time “Vault Tec” has been mentioned in the ARG.
* “Black Row” may refer to Merchant’s Row, a section of Cambridge, MA that is located close to MIT.


20:24 - The timer has been fixed. Set to expire in 11 minutes.


20:08 - IRC users discover some mirror websites. Most likely not related to the ARG.
* http://thesurvivor2299.ru


19:55 - Site sputters up, running an updated nginx 1.4.4 and PHP 5.4.21, with a timer change (added 12 hours)
* The site now serves (via PHP) a number of seconds till the countdown’s end, rather than serving Unix time.
   * This may be to ensure everyone sees it end simultaneously, rather than relying on local clocks.
* The timer will now expire on Dec 2nd, 8:30AM UTC. 
* It appears that the old 404 page is down.


18:00 - Site goes down, possibly under load.


Nov 28th-30th
No updates, possibly because Zenimax’s offices are closed for the Thanksgiving holiday. The ARG may have been planned such that the final pre-Apocalypse message (Boston is gone. No hope.) would be sent shortly before Thanksgiving, so that the lack of activity during the week of Thanksgiving could be explained by the falling of the bombs.


Nov 27th
22:44 - Folks at a pirate radio forum notice odd transmissions on 3450Hz near Boston.
* All radio transmissions are currently considered to be red herrings and fake.
   * The frequency, 3450kHz, is an aviation frequency and there was no record of any flight test being registered for that frequency under any name. In addition, what was broadcasted, which included an air raid sirens and an EAS alert noise, is highly illegal under FCC regulations. No company would risk a $25k fine and a huge PR hit for that kind of stunt.
   * An Arg broadcast would likely be looped for a few hours, not just once or twice
* A short section of a transmission (MP3, shorter file).
   * Redditors were able to translate the DTMF (phone) tones in the transmission above to “IMSECURE” (I’m secure?), probably in response to the last morse code provided in the front page (“return transmission”).
* Concerns have been raised that 3450 is an illegal frequency to use, however fiberkanin suggests possibly otherwise.
* A woman's voice said at one point “the next transmission is at 0200 UTC”. Nothing was heard.
* Over the next 6 hours, an air raid siren is occasionally heard, and uninterpretable voices, may not be legit


20:30 - Front page has new morse code (prov):
* CQ CQ CQ BST IS GONE II BST IS GONE N HPE FREQ 3450 RT GB AMERICA

“Calling all stations, calling all stations, calling all stations. Boston is gone, I repeat, Boston is gone. No Hope. Frequency 3450 Return Transmission. God Bless America.”
* The frequency 3450 lead to the ~20:44 discovery of an odd transmission on 3450Hz.
* File is named Prov; no confirmation of what it means yet. Some suggest Providence, RI, which is close to Boston.


19:32 - IRC user threedog_ points out the favicon, when opened as a text file, reads “V119-QR”. 
* This may stand for Vault 119 - Quabbin Reservoir.
* The favicon’s date modified is Nov 26th 01:26


Nov 26th
00:14 - http://thesurvivor2299.com/radio/ is now a 403, whereas previously it was simply an empty page.


23:21 - http://thesurvivor2299.org and http://thesurvivor2299.net are registered. Both redirect to the .com domain. Oddly, whois information for both are hidden, but a DNS record search indicates that the domains are, in fact, directly connected to the main site (they share nameservers) as well as Zenimax (the support email) 


19:02 - Front page has new morse code (hanscom-msg):
* CQ CQ CQ DE VT 2510730 ONE SIX EMRG VT SHLT FER SURV QBN NR 119 ii EMRG VT SHLT FER SURV QBN NR 119 K
“Calling all stations, calling all stations, calling all stations, this is Vault Technician 2510730 one six emergency Vault-Tec shelter for survivors in Quabbin, number 119, repeat, emergency Vault-Tec shelter for survivors in Quabbin, number 119, over”
* Words highlighted in RED are non-confident meanings
* VT might mean “Vault”, “Vault-Tec”, “Vault Technician”, or a location (town?)
* NR could mean ‘NUMBER’ or ‘NEAR’
* Number 119 is the Boston radio code for Fire Detail
* Number 119 could also refer to Vermont 119, a road that passes near Quabbin
* (This is not the first message to end in a ‘K’, see Nov. 24th. Please don’t add again)


Nov 25th:
19:34-19:40 - thesurvivor2299.com struggles, sometimes returning 500 server error’s. 


19:21 - Fallout: New Vegas updated, officially stating “Fixed cloud saves.”
* IRC User LT_Albrecht, a member of the ‘Tale of Two Wastelands’ team, has confirmed that the changes are unrelated to the ARG. The updated files are minimal, and do not contain any information.
* Confirmed by multiple users in IRC.


19:02 - Front page plays new morse code (longfellow): 
“NCRA UNIT BST 314 7 EMRG MSG NEW YORK STAGE 7 WASHINGTON STAGE 7 LOS ANGELES STAGE 7 AUSTIN STAGE 7 CHICAGO STAGE 7 NEW ORLEAN STAGE 7 LAS VEGAS UNKNOWN MIAMI STAGE 7 DALLAS STAGE 7 DENVER STAGE 7 SAN DIEGO STAGE 7 SAN FRANCISCO STAGE 7 BOSTO-”
* It appears the message was cut off part way through saying ‘Boston’, before giving it’s stage number
* The ‘Stage 7’ refers the the International Nuclear Event Scale, ‘Stage 7’ being the most severe.
* The morse ends just before Boston is given a stage level, possibly indicating the senders location was hit
* ‘Las Vegas - Unknown’ is most likely a result of Mr. House’s actions to prevent the city from being directly hit
* NCRA is possibly an acronym for National Catastrophe Relief Auxiliary, a group that was dispatched the day before the Great War to various locations in case of emergencies
* ‘UNIT BST 314 7’ may be referring to a military or science unit stationed in Boston, and/or giving it’s current scale level (e.g. Unit 314 Boston - Stage 7?) as it is uncommon to use breaks in a military detachment or science team without the use of a hyphen 
Nov 24th:
22:00 - IRC user dsmndlckhrt suggests a possible Fallout 4 map, based on locations in the ARG.
20:44 - Front Page has changed (fall-river):
* New front page countdown: “Nuclear winter is coming in #days #h #m #s” (Dec 1st)
   * New countdown is named “art-count”, possibly to concept art release? If so, previous countdown is “vid-count”, possibly to video release?
* New morse code mp3:
   * OZ De SZ Msg + EF Is Hit ii EF Is Hit K
   * Common morse code shorthand says: De = “this is” or “from”, Msg = “message: “
   * Based on the (now 404’d) /525478, we can read OZ as BGP (Bridgeport??), SZ as CNC (Commander in Chief?? Concord (Massachusetts)? USS Connecticut?), and EF as Quabbin Reservoir
   * CNC is probably Concord MA, given its proximity to the Quabbin Reservoir
   * Possible Translation: 
“Bridgeport, this is Concord (MA), message: Quabbin Reservoir is hit, repeat, Quabbin Reservoir is hit, over.”

20:00-20:18 - New links/activity discovered (404’d 30 minutes later):
* /525478 says “QBN = EF | BGP = OZ | CNC = SZ” | currently 404 imgur backup
* /5625478 says “ONE” | currently 404
* /5725478 says “SIX” | currently 404

17:10 - Redditor allgoodnamestakin ran a brute force of pages with names 7 digits long and got /5625478/.
   * 1740 update - Now 404
   * 1715 update - UNSOLVED new contents say: “ONE” 
   * UNSOLVED contents say: "2510730 PLEASE STAND BY"


00:58 - Redditor Bullshii finds /22472855 which shows “VT137BST7667-LCKHRT: FILE NOT FOUND”
   * Found by typing LLUB (from Nov 23 - 11:48PM) on a mobile keyboard (5582), then reversing it to get 2855
   * Punching “LOCKHRT” on a mobile keyboard gives 5625478, which leads to the Nov 24 - 17:10 discovery.
   * STILL UNCONFIRMED that it may refer to Desmond Lockhart, from Point Lookout
   * According to the Wiki, “(...) he will mention traveling north to pursue his next rival (...)”
   * Boston is northeast of Point Lookout.


Nov 23rd:
23:48 - IRC user ETDellums posts new link leading to /23710-7667-1660/. “19.04 || 2247 LLUB”
   * 2247 LLUB led to (Nov 24 - 12:58AM)
   * 19.04 remains UNSOLVED


20:30 - New page /7042299 found, based on the date in the recent translated cipher.  “GBG #23710-7667-?”
   * GBG is Granary Burying Ground. It was established in 1660, which goes into the ? part, leading to the 23:48 LLUB discovery


19:30 - Cipher (Beaufort) added to frontpage, translates to:
“THE QUABBIN RESERVOIR 7 04 2299”
   * “BFT” is the Beaufort, “CASE/S” is crossed-out, and believed to mean it is not “case sensitive”, “UPPR” may mean “uppercase”.
   * Deciphered message: The dates from the previous cipher (11/25, monday) and (12/27, friday) are the key “mondayfriday”. Passing through a Beaufort decoder, it reads “enineninowtowtruoforeznevesriovresernibbauqeht”. Reading it backwards, you get “the quabbin reservoir seven zero four two two nine nine”. Quabbin Reservoir is in Massachusetts. 


19:00 - /u/maeestro links the phone number from the site update to a woman called Cindy Tallent who works for ZeniMax. The same phone number is also registered to a company called ‘Vir2l Media’, a company that specialises in ‘interactive media and interactive marketing’. Upon calling the number, a ‘ZeniMax’ (needs confirmation, how do you know it was ZeniMax’s and not Vir2l Media’s) answering machine replied: ‘Vir2L Studios has applied design innovation and creative solutions to a broad variety of platforms and media. In addition, Vir2L has developed for tall technical challenges in cross-platform media, with a strong history in high impact web sites, multiple-platform games, CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs, interactive advertising, and full-motion video.’


1800 - IRC users note that Bethblog.com, thesurvivor2299.com and vir2l.com all use nginx 0.6.76, a version that has been outdated for already 5 years (a reverse proxy server) with bethsoft.com and zenimax.com also using nginx, but their versions are not stated.


17:00 - It is noticed that the site and bethblog use the same (5 year old) version of nginx


00:30 - StevePirates notices the two dates are equidistant from 12/11/2013.


00:00 - Cipher changed on site’s frontpage, (Vigenere) translates to:

VGNR   [CAP] - ***? - LET- “12/27/2013 || 11/25/2013”
The VGNR is believed to refer to it being a Vigenere cipher. CAP = Cipher Analytical Protocol The keyword SEVEN was gotten from the morse code at the end of the phone call (Nov 21 11:00PM) which translated to “CODE7667” with the “***?” indicating that we should use the 4th number.


Nov 22nd:
15:30 - New cipher (Caesar) added to frontpage, translates to:


”MY DEAR SISTER. I’M HEADING TO THE INSTITUTE. GOD KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE NOW. THIS OLD BASTARD WILL HELP US. HE MUST HELP US. –0321–”


00:45 - Site frontpage changed:

Nuclear winter is coming. Reserve your future home today! ###PERMISSION DENIED BY OVERSEER (15334) ###


?? - Page /V137 found by guessing based on the .mp3 name of the third (current) morse code, unsure how it relates to things yet


Nov 21st:
23:00 - Site frontpage added:
Nuclear winter is coming. Reserve your future home today! 877-260-2299
   * The phone number (went out of service within a few hours) played Tranquility Lane music, followed by morse code that said “CODE 7667” (partially used in Nov 23 at 00:00 to decipher text on the front page).


20:20 - Site’s background morse code has changed. The new code is:
CQ/CQ/CQ/DE/OZ/PSE/AS
Which translates to:
“Calling any station. Calling any station. Calling any station. This is OZ. Please stand by.”


19:00 - Mp3 is found by accident that sounds a lot like a Fallout trailer’s soundtrack.
   * Confirmed fake by the original finder


Nov 19th:
The Tumblr/Twitter are confirmed by their authors to be fake


Nov 14th:
http://thesurvivor2299.com/ (henceforth referred to as ‘the site’) is first found by a redditor who was watching all domain registrations by Zenimax. It was broadcasting morse code that translated to “11.12.13”. Shortly after discovery, the morse code was changed to mean “11.12.13 12.11.13”, which is both the European and US date formats for the end of the javascript Countdown.

Unsolved Riddles:
   * Nothing now...
Loose Ends:
   * Nov 24 - 20:00 - “ONE” and “SIX”
   * Nov 24 - 17:10 - “2510730 PLEASE STAND BY” (may have just meant we had to wait for the 20:44 morse code)
   * Nov 23 - 23:48 - The meaning of “19.04” (could possibly branch off from the LLUB riddle)
   * Nov 22 - 15:30 - Who “–0321–” is (an Android??) 
   * Nov 22 - 12:45 - No use yet for the Overseer (15334) number
   * Nov 22 - /V137 found by guessing based on the .mp3 name of the third (current) morse code
   * Dates: 11/25, 12/1, 12/11, 12/27

“File not found.” appears for all files ending in .php
An empty page means that the directory is there, but someone created an empty “index.html” file inside it. It’s probably the simplest way to block a directory listing while allowing access to the contents in that directory.

Red Herrings (bad leads, ignore):


   * Piotr Ostrowski: Some poor guy who may have worked with Bethesda in the past. The name came from an email address vaguely related to the site, and he was found hosting Fallout and Skyrim DLCs on a Polish torrent website. A witch hunt ensued, resulting in him deleting everything with his name on it (G+, etc), and now Reddit won’t leave him alone.
   * Erik Todd Dellums: The voice actor for Three Dog. Has stated he’s “just a fan”, and doesn’t know any more than we do. He’s maintained a Twitter account broadcasting daily Fallout themed music for a year. It is encouraged not to pester Erik as even if he did know something, he is bound to a Non Disclosure Agreement with legal repercussions if broken, he won’t break it just because some fanboy on the internet asked nicely. Just like to point to my post about ETD, covering his antics the past few months
   * Cindy Tallent, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at ZeniMax has the 877-260-2299 number the site teased currently registered to her name. She has links to Bethesda’s marketing department, ‘Vir2l Media’ who would be behind this site if it is legit. It’s emphasised that the site owner, whoever that may be, had access to this number in order to shut it down after we had gained the code. This is all she will be relevant for as she will also be bound by an NDA, and as she is on the corporate side of the company, she might not actually know much about Fallout 4 at all other than finances and in-direct marketing.
   * Reddit user hotsnowbchyn posted a number of equations, that, when added up and put into a direct alphabet-to-number cypher, says: 
   * "THIS IS THE OVERSEEVTF [sic] VAULT 137  REQESTING [sic] HELP VE [sic] ARE FREEZING AND RUNNING OUT OF FOOD"
   * vaultofthefuture.net doesn’t fit the art style of Fallout whatsoever, and the html is questionable. It links to the official twitter, yet not the official facebook? Fake.
   * Most, if not all of the HAM radio transmissions have been concluded to be fake.
   * vault119.com is fake, as it was registered Nov 29 by namecheap.com
